    In this file, we'll learn how we can perform operations on our variables, 
    constants, and optionals.

    In the previous lesson, we learned that what types of data 
    we can store in our digital boxes.

    Now, we'll learn how to manipulate what's inside of them. Since each data type is different,
    the operations we can perform are expressed somewhat differently.

    First, we'll look at the three types of operations we can perform than
    we'll look at how to use the operators within them.

    Types of operations:
        - Mathematical operations
        - Comparison operations
        - Logical operations

    1. Mathematical operations

        The mathematical operations are:
            - Addition (+)
            - Subtraction (-)
            - Multiplication (*)
            - Division (/)
            - Remainder (%)

        The data types I can use these on with are:
            - Number types: Integers and Decimals
            - Text type: Only strings
        
    2. Comparison operations

        The comparison operations are:
            - Equal to (==)
            - Not equal to (!=)
            - Greater than (>)
            - Less than (<)
            - Greater than or equal to (>=)
            - Less than or equal to (<=)

        The data types I can use these on with are:
            - Number types: Integers and Decimals
            - Text type: Only strings
            - Boolean type: Only booleans

    3. Logical operations
    
        The logical operations are:
            - AND (&&)
            - OR (||)
            - NOT (!)

        The data types I can use these on are:
            - Boolean type: Only booleans

// Create a variable called age and assign it any integer value you want


// Print the value of age


// Write an if statement that checks if age is greater or equal to 0 AND less than 125
// If it is, print "Your age is valid"
// If it's not, print "Your age is invalid"


// Create a variable called name and assign it any string value you want


// Print the value of name


// Create another variable called helloMessage and assign it use the + operator to combine the string "Hello, " 
//with the name variable


// Print the value of helloMessage


// Create a constant called grade and assign it any integer value you want

// Print the value of grade

//Now take the grade constant and reassign a number to it like this
//grade = 10

//Then try to print the value of grade again


//What happened? Why did this happen?
