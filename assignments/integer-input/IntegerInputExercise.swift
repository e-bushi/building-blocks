/*

    Write a program that takes two user-provided integers as arguments and outputs the sum of those integers 
    using the + operator. Then, introduce conditions such as handling invalid input (negative or decimal values), 
    so that the program asks the user to provide valid input before performing calculations.


    Example Output:

    Please enter the first integer:

    5

    Please enter the second integer:

    10

    The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.
